# git-preflight

Simplifies the final self-review before committing changes to Git.

## Usage

Use this extension to review your uncommitted changes in a clean, readable diff view — ideal for a quick sanity check before committing.

**Trigger the command:**
- Command Palette: `Git Preflight: Show Diff`
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+R` (macOS)

## When to use

Run it right before you commit to catch accidental changes, debug leftovers, or forgotten TODOs.
